### What is it?
**JooMDD** provides a set of plugins for model-driven development of Joomla! extension 
packages. 
The current version of JooMDD can be used as plugins within ***Eclipse***, 
***IntelliJ IDEA***, and ***PhpStorm***. Additionally we provide the  [***JooMDD web editor***](https://tinyurl.com/joomdd-web).

### How does it work?
Use the straightforward and text-based eJSL language for abstract definitions of Joomla components, modules, plugins, and templates. To this end, you can use the integrated model editors which come with features like auto completion, syntax highlighting, and live validation.

Based on these models the JooMDD code generator creates installable extension code for Joomla-based web sites. JooMDD supports Joomla versions 3 and 4.  

### What do I get?
Installable extension packages for Joomla 3.x and Joomla 4.

# Contribution
Please read through our [contribution guidelines](#) and feel free to open [new issues]().

A hard requirement for contribution as infrastructure developer is the willingness to work with the Eclipse IDE and at least understand the [Xtend](https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/) language, which is a Java-based dialect. In addition, knowledge in grammar definitions with [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) and constraint implementation with the [Object Constraint Language (OCL)](https://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/) is very helpful for contributing the project.

# Versioning
In this project, we follow the [Semantic Versioning Guidelines](https://semver.org/). I.e. we use major, minor, and patch increments in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for our plugin versions.

Latest versions of JooMDD plugins can be found in the [releases](#) section.
