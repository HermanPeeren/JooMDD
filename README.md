**JooMDD** provides an MDD infrastructure for the model-driven development of Joomla extension packages and Joomla application packages with concrete data.

The current version of the infrastructure can be used as plugins within the Eclipse IDE. We are currently working on support for IntelliJ-based IDEs. We are also working on a web-based solution for a simple and independent use of our approach.

## Installation of JooMDD ##
Easily install the JooMDD tools through the use of the following update site within the update manager in Eclipse. Please use the plugins within Eclipse Kepler, Luna, or Mars.
